EZShellExtensions.Net 2013 License String :

Attached with this email is a file named "EZShellExtensions.shelldata". 

To properly license EZShellExtensions.Net, you have to include this file as an "Embedded Resource" in your assembly file. 
To do this, copy the EZShellExtensions.shelldata file to your project directory and add it to your project. 
Then set the action for the file to "Embedded Resource" in the Visual Studio.Net properties window. 
Please note that the name of the file must be "EZShellExtensions.shelldata" for the licensing to properly work.

Please take note of the following :
1. The license holder's name, company name and email is embedded in the license string, so each license string is traceable to the person/company which purchased the license.
2. The controls are licensed on a per-developer basis, so only as many developers can use this license as indicated in the license information above. If additional developers need to use the controls, you will need additional licenses.
3.Also note that the license is not a concurrent license but is a named license, so different developers cannot use the same license at any time.
